# EC327_FinalProj
Final project of EC327 which is a recreation of the game 2048.

1. Download Visual Studio(VS) on your device
2. Download the "Live Server" extension on VS
3. Load our 2048.js, index.html, and style.css, into VS with the same naming convention
4. Right click on index.html and click "Open with live server"

The app would then pull up a browser which you can play using the WASD keys or arrow keys.
